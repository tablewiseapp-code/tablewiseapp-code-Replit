You are Replit AI. Update the existing “Import Recipe” screen (React + TypeScript). 
We already have automatic AI generation that can parse free text into Title / Ingredients / Steps.
Do NOT add a “where to put it” modal and do NOT require field focus.

GOAL
Add ONE microphone-based dictation feature that:
1) Records voice
2) Converts speech to raw text (transcript)
3) Sends that raw text into the existing AI auto-splitting pipeline
4) Auto-fills Title / Ingredients / Steps

UI REQUIREMENTS
Add a new card section between “Source link (optional)” and “Title”:

- Label: “VOICE (AI)”
- Title: “Speak your recipe”
- Subtext: “Say the recipe out loud — we’ll transcribe it and auto-fill title, ingredients, and steps.”
- Buttons:
  - Primary: “Start dictation”
  - While recording: button changes to “Stop”
  - After stop (if transcript exists): show a button “Transcribe & auto-fill”
- Show a small status line:
  - Idle: “Tip: Say title → ingredients → steps.”
  - Recording: “Listening…”
  - After stop: “Transcript ready.”

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
A) Speech-to-text (client-only)
- Use the Web Speech API:
  - const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition
- If unsupported:
  - Disable the dictation button and show: “Voice transcription isn’t supported in this browser.”
- Setup:
  - recognition.continuous = true
  - recognition.interimResults = true
  - recognition.lang = "en-US" (or keep as a constant to change later)
- Accumulate FINAL results into `transcript` string (ignore interim for final buffer, but can display interim live if easy).
- On Stop: stop recognition safely and freeze transcript.

B) AI auto-fill integration (IMPORTANT)
- The app already has an AI function that takes free text and returns:
  { title: string, ingredients: string[], steps: string[] }
- Find and reuse that existing function. Do NOT create a new AI pipeline.
- When user clicks “Transcribe & auto-fill”:
  1) Call the existing AI parsing function with the transcript text.
  2) Set form fields:
     - Title input value
     - Ingredients textarea value as lines joined by "\n"
     - Steps textarea value as lines joined by "\n"
- Show loading state while AI runs:
  - Disable buttons
  - Button text: “Processing…”

C) Quality + safety behavior
- Provide “Clear” link to clear transcript only (does not clear fields).
- Dictation must not overwrite existing fields blindly:
  - If fields already contain text, append with a blank line separator OR ask via a simple confirm dialog:
    “Replace existing content?” with OK=replace, Cancel=append.
  (Choose the simplest: use window.confirm)

D) No backend
- No server routes.
- No external libraries.
- Keep everything client-side.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement this in the existing Import screen file.
- Output:
  - Files changed
  - Manual test checklist:
    1) Start dictation
    2) Speak a recipe
    3) Stop
    4) Transcribe & auto-fill
    5) Verify Title/Ingredients/Steps are filled
