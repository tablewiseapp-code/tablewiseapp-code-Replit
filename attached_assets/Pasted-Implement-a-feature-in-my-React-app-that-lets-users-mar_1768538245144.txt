Implement a feature in my React app that lets users mark recipes as “My Picks ⭐”, rate them with a 5-star self review, and filter recipes on the Step 2 — Meals screen by My Picks (and optionally by rating threshold).

Context / Screens

There is a Recipe Detail screen (where notes are).

There is a Step 2 — Meals screen that lists recipes and already has filters like:

“With my notes”

“Modified by me”

Add a new filter: My Picks ⭐

Data Model

Extend per-recipe user-specific metadata (do not change core recipe fields):

type RecipeUserMeta = {
  isMyPick: boolean;     // default false
  rating: number | null; // 1..5, null if not rated
  ratedAt?: string;      // optional ISO date
};


Assume recipes look like:

type Recipe = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  // ...existing fields...
  userMeta?: RecipeUserMeta;
};

Requirements
1) Recipe Detail: My Picks ⭐ Toggle

Add a toggle control near the recipe title area.

Off state label: ☆ Add to My Picks

On state label: ★ In My Picks

Behavior:

Clicking ON:

Sets isMyPick=true

Immediately reveals a 5-star rating UI (inline, not modal)

Shows a prompt text above stars: “How did this turn out?”

Clicking OFF:

Sets isMyPick=false

Rating should be preserved in data (do not delete it), but hidden unless isMyPick=true

(If you prefer, you may set rating=null when turning off, but only if you justify in comments. Default: preserve.)

2) 5-Star Self Review Component

Create a reusable component:

StarRating

Props:

value: number | null

onChange(next: number): void

readOnly?: boolean

size?: "sm" | "md"

Behavior:

Render 5 clickable stars.

Hover/focus shows preview highlight.

Click sets rating 1..5.

Clicking the currently selected star again may keep the rating (no toggle-off) unless you implement clear “clear rating” UI (optional).

Accessible:

Buttons with aria-labels like “Rate 3 out of 5”

Keyboard support (left/right to change, enter/space to set) is a plus.

When the rating is set:

Update recipe userMeta.rating and set ratedAt = now (ISO string).

3) Step 2 — Meals: Filters

In the filters panel add:

Checkbox: My Picks ⭐

Filtering logic:

When checked, show only recipes where userMeta.isMyPick === true.

Combine with existing filters using AND behavior.

Optional (recommended) rating filter:

Dropdown or segmented control:

“Any rating”

“4★ & up”

“3★ & up”

“2★ & up”

Only applies when My Picks filter is on (or apply globally if it’s easier, but explain).

If rating is null, it should not match “X★ & up”.

4) Recipe List UI Indicators

On the Meals list items/cards:

If isMyPick=true, show a small badge or icon: ★ My Pick

If rating exists, show stars summary like ★★★★☆ (readOnly) or “4★”.

5) Persistence

Implement persistence in one of these ways (choose the simplest that matches the current app):

If the app already uses a store (Context/Zustand/Redux), integrate there.

Otherwise, store per-recipe userMeta in localStorage keyed by recipe id, e.g. recipe_user_meta_${id} or one consolidated key.

Must persist across refresh.

6) Code Output

Provide:

Updated components for Recipe Detail (toggle + rating).

Updated Step 2 — Meals screen (filters + list).

StarRating component.

A small useRecipeUserMeta hook or helper functions for reading/writing meta + localStorage.

Clear inline comments explaining:

filtering logic

persistence strategy

why rating is shown only for My Picks

Acceptance Criteria (must pass)

Marking a recipe as “My Picks” immediately shows the star rating prompt.

Rating saves and persists across refresh.

Step 2 filter “My Picks ⭐” shows only those recipes.

Rating threshold filter works (if implemented).

UI shows badge + rating summary in the list.

No crashes if userMeta is missing (must default safely).

Style / Tech Constraints

React + TypeScript preferred (ok if JS but TS is better).

Keep it minimal and clean.

Avoid heavy libraries. Use inline SVG stars or a simple icon approach.
