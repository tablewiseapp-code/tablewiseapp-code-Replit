You are Replit AI working on an existing React + TypeScript web app.

CURRENT STATE
- There is already an “Import Recipe” screen with:
  - Title input
  - Ingredients textarea (one per line)
  - Steps textarea (one per line)
  - “Save & open” and “Back” buttons
- Everything is stored locally in the browser.
- No backend exists and none should be added.

GOAL
Extend the existing Import Recipe screen by adding TWO new optional features:
1) Take / add a photo
2) Add a recipe URL

These must be OPTIONAL and must NOT block saving a recipe.

DO NOT redesign the whole screen.
Add these features in a clean, minimal way.

––––––––––––––––––
FEATURE 1: TAKE / ADD A PHOTO
––––––––––––––––––

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Add a new section ABOVE the Title input.
- Label: “Photo (optional)”
- Show a dashed card/button with:
  - Camera icon or placeholder
  - Text: “Take a photo or upload”
- Clicking it should open a file input:
  - <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">

BEHAVIOR
- Allow selecting ONE image only (for now).
- After selection:
  - Show a small preview thumbnail
  - Show a small “Remove” (×) button
- Image is optional.

STORAGE
- Store the image as a base64 string in localStorage.
- Add to Recipe model:

type Recipe = {
  ...
  image?: string; // base64
}

––––––––––––––––––
FEATURE 2: ADD URL
––––––––––––––––––

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Add a new section BELOW the photo section and ABOVE the Title input.
- Label: “Source link (optional)”
- Single-line input field with placeholder:
  “Paste recipe link (Instagram, website, YouTube)”

BEHAVIOR
- Validate URL format lightly (try/catch new URL()).
- If invalid, show a small inline hint (do NOT block saving).
- If valid, store it.

STORAGE
- Extend Recipe model:

type Recipe = {
  ...
  sourceUrl?: string;
}

––––––––––––––––––
SAVE BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)
––––––––––––––––––

- “Save & open” must:
  - Save title, ingredients, steps
  - ALSO save image (if exists)
  - ALSO save sourceUrl (if exists)
- Recipe screen should:
  - Display the image at the top if exists
  - Display the source link as a small clickable link if exists

––––––––––––––––––
RULES
––––––––––––––––––

- Keep everything client-side only.
- Use localStorage only.
- Do NOT add external libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- Do NOT remove or rename existing fields.
- Keep styling consistent with the existing UI.
- No advanced parsing, OCR, or AI logic yet.

––––––––––––––––––
DELIVERABLE
––––––––––––––––––

After implementation, output:
1) Files changed
2) Short explanation of how photo + URL are stored
3) Manual test steps (3–4 bullets)
