You are Replit AI. You will modify my existing web app (React + TypeScript) that currently has ONLY a single “Recipe” screen. Your task is to add a new “Import Recipe” flow and connect it from the existing Recipe screen via a button.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- Keep everything client-side only (no backend).
- Use localStorage for persistence (simple + reliable for now).
- Keep UI clean and minimal.
- Do NOT remove or break the existing Recipe screen. Only extend.

WHAT I HAVE NOW (ASSUME)
- There is a current page/component that shows a single recipe screen (RecipeView).
- The project runs in Replit and already has a working app entry.
- If routing does not exist, you must add routing.
- If routing already exists, you must integrate with it.

GOAL UX
1) On the existing Recipe screen, add a primary button at the top: “Import recipe”.
2) Clicking it navigates to a new screen: “Import Recipe”.
3) The import screen lets me paste:
   - Title (single line)
   - Ingredients (one per line)
   - Steps (one per line)
4) A button “Save & open” saves the recipe to localStorage and navigates back to the Recipe screen, showing the newly imported recipe.
5) Add a small “Back” button/link on the Import screen.

DATA MODEL
Create/extend a Recipe type:
type Recipe = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  ingredients: string[]; // each line
  steps: string[];       // each line
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
};

LOCAL STORAGE
- Key name: "tw_current_recipe"
- Save full Recipe as JSON string.
- On app load, the Recipe screen reads from localStorage. If missing, show an “Empty state”:
  - Title: “No recipe yet”
  - Button: “Import recipe”

ROUTING (DO THIS EXACTLY)
If the project already uses react-router:
- Add a route for /import that renders ImportRecipePage
- Ensure / renders the Recipe screen
If the project does NOT use routing:
- Install react-router-dom
- Wrap app with <BrowserRouter>
- Create Routes:
  - "/" -> RecipePage
  - "/import" -> ImportRecipePage

PARSING RULES (IMPORT SCREEN)
- Ingredients textarea: split by newline, trim each line, remove empty lines
- Steps textarea: split by newline, trim each line, remove empty lines
- Title: trim (allow empty, but prefer non-empty; show a small hint if empty)

UI DETAILS (MINIMAL)
ImportRecipePage layout:
- Header: “IMPORT”
- Title: “Bring your recipe”
- Subtitle: “Paste a title, ingredient lines, and steps. Stored locally in your browser.”
- Input: Title (placeholder: “e.g., Quinoa bowls with veggies”)
- Textarea: Ingredients (label: “Ingredients (one per line)”)
- Textarea: Steps (label: “Steps (one per line)”)
- Buttons row:
  - Primary: “Save & open”
  - Secondary: “Back”
- Small info card at bottom “How it works” with 2–3 bullets.

RecipePage layout changes:
- Add “Import recipe” button near the top (primary).
- Display recipe title, then Ingredients list, then Steps list.
- If empty state, show the empty state described above.

FILES TO CREATE/EDIT (DO NOT GUESS RANDOM NAMES — LOCATE REAL ONES)
- Find the current Recipe screen component file and edit it to add the button + read localStorage.
- Add a new component/page: ImportRecipePage.tsx
- Add/update the router in the main entry (App.tsx or main.tsx/index.tsx).
- Add a small utility file lib/storage.ts for get/set current recipe (optional but preferred).

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (DO IN ORDER)
1) Inspect the repo structure and identify:
   - App entry file
   - Existing Recipe screen component
2) Add routing (or extend existing routing) with / and /import.
3) Implement localStorage helpers:
   - loadCurrentRecipe(): Recipe | null
   - saveCurrentRecipe(recipe: Recipe): void
4) Implement ImportRecipePage with controlled inputs and “Save & open”.
5) Update Recipe screen to:
   - load recipe on mount
   - show empty state if none
   - show recipe if present
   - navigate to /import when “Import recipe” clicked
6) Quick manual QA:
   - Start app
   - Click Import recipe
   - Paste content
   - Save & open
   - Verify recipe renders and persists on refresh

OUTPUT
When finished, print:
- Which files you changed/added
- How to run in Replit (one short line)
- A short manual test checklist (3–5 bullets)

IMPORTANT
- Do not add advanced features (photos/links) yet. Only the basic import flow described above.
- Keep code TypeScript-safe and readable.
