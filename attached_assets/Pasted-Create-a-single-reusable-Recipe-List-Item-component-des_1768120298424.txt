Create a single reusable “Recipe List Item” component (desktop web) that matches the attached style: a compact calm card with a monogram, title, tags, source/tools metadata, and two secondary buttons at the bottom.

Deliver as a small runnable demo in 3 files: index.html, styles.css, app.js (vanilla only, no frameworks, no Tailwind/Bootstrap).

VISUAL TARGET (match the screenshot)
- Card: soft off-white background, rounded corners (16–20px), subtle shadow, generous padding.
- Layout: 
  - Top row: left monogram circle “PP”, center title “Pesto Pasta with Tomatoes” (wrap to two lines), right small pill button “Add”.
  - Middle: a horizontal wrap row of small tags (chips): “20 Min”, “Lunch”, “Vegetarian”, and a small “+2” chip.
  - Below tags: three quiet metadata lines:
    - “Source: Garden Pantry”
    - “classical” (as a subtle chip/badge)
    - “Tools: stove”
  - Bottom row: two buttons:
    - Left primary-ish button: “Open recipe” (soft green fill like in screenshot, rounded pill)
    - Right secondary button: “Ingredients” (outlined pill)

TYPOGRAPHY & COLORS
- Calm, modern system font.
- Text: dark gray/near-black.
- Tags: light gray pills with subtle border.
- “Add” button: small outlined pill, minimal.
- “Open recipe” button: muted green fill (not bright), white text.
- No other bright colors.

INTERACTION (simple)
- Clicking “Add” toggles to “Added” state (same pill style but slightly darker border or filled very lightly). Toggle back on click.
- Clicking “Open recipe” shows a minimal inline area under the card (expand/collapse) with:
  - “Recipe preview” title and 3–5 ingredient lines (plain text).
- Clicking “Ingredients” opens the same inline area but scrolls/focuses to ingredients list.
- No modals, no popups.

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS
- Build it as a function in app.js that renders from data:
  { initials:"PP", title:"Pesto Pasta with Tomatoes", minutes:20, meal:"Lunch", tags:["Vegetarian"], extraTag:"+2", source:"Garden Pantry", sourceTag:"classical", tools:"stove", ingredients:[...] }
- Render at least 3 example cards in a vertical list with consistent spacing.

OUTPUT
Return complete code for index.html, styles.css, app.js that produces a high-fidelity result matching the screenshot’s layout and calm styling.
