Create a single desktop web page for “Weekly plan → Meals” in the Tablewise style: calm, professional, no clutter, Jobs-like restraint. Build as 3 files: index.html, styles.css, app.js. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks, no Tailwind/Bootstrap, no UI libraries).

GOAL
A calm recipe picker screen where the user selects 6–12 dinner options. The UI must feel like a quiet planning tool (not a marketplace). No cards, no heavy borders, no bright colors, no gamification, no ads.

PAGE STRUCTURE (Desktop)
- Top brand bar (very quiet):
  - Left: circular “TW” mark + “Tablewise” + subtitle “Calm weekly planning”
  - Right: minimal text links: “How it works”, “Plan”, “Cost”, and a subtle “Log in” button
  - Keep the bar low height, lots of whitespace, hairline bottom divider.

- Main area: centered surface container (max-width ~1200px, 80–90vh)
  - Two columns:
    1) LEFT FILTER RAIL (narrow, calm, collapsible sections)
    2) RIGHT RESULTS CANVAS (dominant list)

------------------------------------------------------------
LEFT FILTER RAIL (calm + minimal)
------------------------------------------------------------
Design rules:
- Must not look like a dense settings menu.
- Use collapsible groups (accordion). Only 2 groups open by default.
- Show a small “Filters (N)” count at top (N updates as user selects filters).
- Add a “Clear all” text button (muted).

Primary filters (visible by default):
1) Max minutes: slider or segmented options (Any / 20 / 30 / 40 / 60)
2) Dietary: checkboxes (Vegetarian, Kid friendly, Gluten-free)
3) Meal type: chips (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Lunch box)
4) Cooking method: chips (Oven, Air fryer, Stovetop, No-cook)
5) Source: chips (My recipes, Imported, Trusted authors, Personal)

Advanced filters (collapsed by default under “More filters”):
- Protein type (Chicken, Beef, Seafood, Plant-based)
- With my notes (toggle)
- Modified by me (toggle)
- Servings (1–2, 3–4, 5+)
- Ingredients: “Must include” and “Must exclude” with small addable chips

Interaction rules:
- Selecting any filter updates Filters (N).
- “Clear all” resets everything.
- Keep typography small and quiet, no bold headings except section titles.
- No bright checkbox colors; use neutral grays.

------------------------------------------------------------
RIGHT RESULTS CANVAS (recipe list)
------------------------------------------------------------
Top of canvas:
- Title: “Step 2 — Meals”
- Subtitle: “Choose dinners with calm filters. Select 6–12 options. We’ll build a week from there.”
- A quiet selected counter on the right: “Selected: X / 12”
- No banners, no illustrations.

Recipe results layout:
- Render results as a clean vertical LIST (NOT cards).
- Each row has:
  - Left: two-letter monogram (PP, VG…) in a subtle circle
  - Middle: Title (primary), and one muted metadata line:
    “20 min • lunch • vegetarian • Tools: stove”
    (keep it one line; truncate if long)
  - Right: ONE primary action button “Add” (or if already selected, “Added” with subtle style)
- Entire row is clickable to “Open recipe” (secondary action) but do NOT show an extra button.
  - On click: open a minimal right-side inline drawer or a modal-like panel that shows a tiny preview (title + ingredients only) — keep it extremely minimal, no big overlays. Alternatively, use a simple details area below the row that expands.
- Do NOT show “Ingredients” as a separate button for every row.
- Selected recipes should have a subtle indicator (e.g., a thin left bar or a checkmark in gray), not a colored highlight.

Bottom of canvas:
- Primary action: “Generate weekly plan”
  - Enabled only when Selected >= 6
  - If less than 6 selected, disabled with a quiet hint text: “Select at least 6 to generate.”
- Secondary text: “You can adjust this later.” (muted)

Footer (very quiet):
- “Built for families—no ads, no sponsored meals.”
- “v0.1 prototype”
- “Tablewise | Calm weekly planning”

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA + FUNCTIONALITY (app.js)
------------------------------------------------------------
Provide sample data array of ~12 recipes with fields:
- id, title, minutes, mealType, tags (vegetarian, kidFriendly, glutenFree), tools[], sourceType, proteinType, servingsRange, hasNotes, modifiedByMe, ingredients[]

Filtering:
- Filters must actually work (minutes, dietary, meal type, method/tools, source, protein, notes, modified, servings).
- Must include/exclude ingredients filter:
  - User can type an ingredient and press Enter to add a chip.
  - “Must include” filters recipes containing that ingredient string.
  - “Must exclude” removes recipes containing that ingredient string.

Selection:
- Clicking “Add” toggles selection for that recipe.
- Maintain selectedIds set in state.
- Update “Selected: X / 12”.
- Prevent selecting more than 12 (if user tries, do nothing and show a tiny muted inline message near the counter: “Max 12 selections.”)

Generate weekly plan:
- Clicking “Generate weekly plan” when enabled:
  - Show a calm confirmation state in the canvas (no popups):
    - “Weekly plan created.”
    - List the selected recipe titles below.
  - No navigation needed.

State persistence:
- Save filters + selectedIds to localStorage.
- Restore on reload.

------------------------------------------------------------
STYLE & TONE
------------------------------------------------------------
- Off-white/warm gray background
- Hairline dividers
- Soft shadows only where necessary
- Clean typography, generous whitespace
- No bright colors
- No emojis, no illustrations
- No “card” UI

OUTPUT
Return complete code for:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
Everything should run immediately and match the calm, minimalist mockup style.
