Build a single desktop “Recipe View” screen as a calm, professional cooking workspace.

DELIVERABLE (3 files)
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
No frameworks. No Tailwind/Bootstrap. No UI libraries. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- Inspired by Steve Jobs: simplicity, focus, clarity, restraint.
- Interface should “disappear while cooking”: low contrast, no clutter, no cards, no gamification, no social elements.
- Timeless, quiet, native-feeling.

GLOBAL STYLE
- Background: off-white / warm gray (#F7F6F3-ish).
- Text: dark gray (#2E2E2E), muted text (#7A7A7A).
- Dividers: 1px hairlines, very light gray.
- Shadows: extremely soft and only where necessary.
- Typography: system font stack:
  -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
- Generous whitespace. No bright colors. No emojis. No images except the right-side dish photo area.
- No animations, no timers.

PAGE LAYOUT (Desktop, no phone frame)
- Full viewport, centered “surface” container with subtle border/shadow.
- Inside surface: 3-column layout:
  1) Left Control Rail (narrow, subtle)
  2) Center Recipe Canvas (dominant)
  3) Right Image Column (calm photo area)

COLUMN 1: LEFT CONTROL RAIL (very subtle)
- Width ~84px.
- Background slightly cooler/lighter than canvas (#F1F1EF-ish).
- Contains ONLY stacked “knob-like” controls (icon + label), no menus, no nav.
- Controls (top to bottom):
  1) Units toggle: g / ml / cups (default: g/ml active)
  2) Cup size: “240 ml” (static or tiny selector; keep quiet)
  3) Servings stepper: “– 2 +” (default 2)
  4) Layout toggle (icon + label)
  5) Nutrition toggle labeled “БЖУ”
  6) Step help toggle labeled “?”
- Each control: minimal hit-area, small label, subtle icon (use simple inline SVGs or plain text icons).
- No big buttons, no cards, no extra copy.

COLUMN 2: RECIPE CANVAS (center, dominant)
TOP AREA
- Title: “Chicken Curry” large, clean, medium weight, centered or left-aligned (choose one, but be consistent).
- Metadata line below (small + muted):
  “Source: Personal • Last cooked: 2 weeks ago • Modified by you”
- Nutrition line is HIDDEN by default. When enabled (БЖУ toggle ON), show ONE line only:
  “Protein 42g • Fat 18g • Carbs 22g”
No charts, no colors, no percentages.

INGREDIENTS (STICKY SECTION)
- Ingredients block is always visible at the top of the canvas while scrolling steps.
- Implement as a sticky section with the same background as canvas and a subtle bottom divider.
- Simple vertical list, one line per ingredient.
- Small checkbox at start of each line.
- Quantity slightly bolder than ingredient name.
- No grouping, no cards, no colored tags.
Example list:
☐ 300g chicken thighs
☐ 1 tbsp olive oil
☐ 1/2 cup yogurt
☐ 1 onion, chopped
☐ 2 cloves garlic

STEPS (FOCUS MODE)
- Steps shown as a vertical flow below ingredients with lots of whitespace.
- One step is active and emphasized.
- Previous step is visible but faded/muted and smaller.
- Next step visible but subtle.
- Active step format:
  STEP 2
  “Sauté onions on low heat for 10 minutes.”  (with a small “?” icon next to it)
- Under active step: a quiet “Next” button (minimal outline, rounded corners, soft shadow only if needed).
- No long explanations.

STEP HELP (CONTEXTUAL, MINIMAL)
- Rail “?” toggle controls whether step help is available.
- When help is enabled AND the user clicks the step’s “?” icon:
  - Show a minimal inline hint line under the active step (NOT chat bubbles, no typing UI).
  - Example hint: “Low heat means the onions soften without browning; stir occasionally.”
  - Style: small muted text; optional hairline left border.
- If help is disabled, hide or disable the step “?” icon.

COLUMN 3: RIGHT IMAGE COLUMN
- Add a calm photo area on the far right.
- Use either:
  - a public placeholder image URL, OR
  - a local placeholder via CSS (gradient box) if you want zero external assets.
- Width ~320px.
- Aligned near the top of the canvas content.
- Subtle rounding (8–12px).
- Keep it quiet: no captions, no overlays.

INTERACTIONS (app.js)
- Units toggle: switches active state styling only.
- Servings stepper: updates number only (no ingredient scaling required).
- Nutrition toggle (БЖУ): show/hide the single nutrition line.
- Step help toggle: enable/disable the “?” icon and hint behavior.
- “Next” button: advances active step (loop or stop at last step). Update:
  - previous step becomes faded
  - current step becomes active
  - next step becomes subtle
- Store current state in JS (activeStepIndex, servings, units, showNutrition, helpEnabled).

ACCESSIBILITY
- Use semantic HTML.
- Buttons have aria-labels.
- Checkboxes are real <input type="checkbox">.
- Focus states are subtle but visible (no neon outlines; use a quiet ring).

CONTENT
- Use 3 steps minimum:
  STEP 1: “Prep the chicken and vegetables.”
  STEP 2: “Sauté onions on low heat for 10 minutes.”
  STEP 3: “Add the chicken and spices.”

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Return the full contents of index.html, styles.css, and app.js.
- Ensure the page runs immediately and matches the described calm, minimalist mockup.
